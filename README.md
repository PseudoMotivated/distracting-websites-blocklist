# List of distracting websites

There may be double entries, or missing entries.
One is parsed already such that it works with the "Distract me not" extension, another is just the domain names.

I also included my `settings.json` file for the extension which you can import by: 
1. Downloading it, click `settings.json`, then the "raw" button and click `ctrl + s`.
2. Navigate to the "miscellaneous" section of the setting in the "Distract me not" extension and click "import".
3. Navigate to where you downloaded the `settings.json` file and double click it or click open.
4. Enjoy not wasting your time!

Feel free to PR!
